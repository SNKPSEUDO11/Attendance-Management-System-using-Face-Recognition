## Features
- **Capture Face Data**: Capture and store images of users for recognition.
- **Train Model**: Train a face recognition model using the captured data.
- **Mark Attendance**: Automatically mark attendance when a recognized face is detected.
- **Show Attendance Records**: View all recorded attendance in a scrollable window.

## Software Requirements
